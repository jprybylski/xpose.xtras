Description: Adding some at-present missing functionality, or functions 
    unlikely to be added to the base 'xpose' package.  This includes some 
    diagnostic plots that have been missing in translation from 'xpose4', 
    but also some useful features that truly extend the capabilities of what 
    can be done with 'xpose'. These extensions include the concept of a set of
    'xpose' objects, and diagnostics for likelihood-based models.
