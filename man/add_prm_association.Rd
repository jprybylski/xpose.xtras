\usage{
add_prm_association(xpdb, ..., .problem, .subprob, .method, quiet)

drop_prm_association(xpdb, ..., .problem, .subprob, .method, quiet)
}
\arguments{
\item{xpdb}{<\code{xp_xtras}> object}

\item{...}{... <\code{\link[rlang:dyn-dots]{dynamic-dots}}> One or more formulas that
define associations between parameters. One list of formulas can also be used,
but a warning is generated.

For \code{drop_prm_association}, this list should be selectors for which associations
will be dropped.}

\item{.problem}{<\code{numeric}> Problem number to apply this relationship.}

\item{.subprob}{<\code{numeric}> Problem number to apply this relationship.}

\item{.method}{<\code{numeric}> Problem number to apply this relationship.}

\item{quiet}{Silence extra output.}
}
\description{
The relationship between structural parameters and
omega parameters can be described. This is useful if
it deviates from the typical log-normal.

Default transformations are those that are built into
\code{pmxcv}, but see examples for how associations can be
described for other relationships.
}
\details{
At time of writing, the built-in distributions for \code{pmxcv} are below.
Those marked with an asterisk require a fixed effect parameter to calculate CV.
\itemize{
\item \code{log} typical log-normal. Optional \code{exact} parameter (if \code{TRUE}, will not
calculate with integration); this is unrelated to the \code{cvtype} option.
\item \code{logexp}* modified log-normal \code{log(1+X)}
\item \code{logit}* logit-normal
\item \code{arcsin}* arcsine-transform
\item \code{nmboxcox}* Box-Cox transform as typically implemented in pharmacometrics.
Requires a \code{lambda} parameter.
}

To pass a custom parameter, use \code{custom} transform, and pass \code{pdist} and \code{qdist} to
that transform. See Examples.

Note that the functions used in describing associations are not real functions,
it is just the syntax for this application. Based on examples, be mindful of
where positional arguments would acceptable and where named arguments are
required. Care has been given to provide a modest amount of flexibility
with informative errors for fragile points, but not every error can be anticipated.
If this function or downstream results from it seem wrong, the association syntax
should be scrutinized.

Format for associations is:
\code{LHS~fun(OMEGA, args...)}

\itemize{
\item LHS: Selector for a fixed effect parameter. Can be \verb{the\{m\}} (eg, the1),
\code{{name}} (eg, THETA1) or \code{{label}} (eg, TVCL). These should \emph{not} be quoted.
Multiple associations can be defined at once with \code{+}. Cannot be empty.
\item RHS: Should be a simple call to only one function, which should be
custom or one of the built-in distributions or \code{custom(...)}. A lot of things
can look like simple calls, so may not break immediately; keep to the described
format and everything should be fine.
\item RHS OMEGA: Selector for omega variable. Similar rules to the fixed
effect selector. Can be \verb{ome\{m\}}, \code{{name}} or \code{{label}}, limited to diagonal
elements. Should \emph{not} be quoted. \code{OMEGA} is not a named argument (\code{OMEGA={selector}}
should \strong{not} be considered valid); whatever is used as the first argument to the
"function" will be considered an OMEGA selector.
\item RHS args: Applies when the distribution has extra arguments. If these
are limited to 1, can be passed by position (eg, \code{lambda} for \code{nmboxcox} and
\code{exact} for \code{log}). For \code{custom()}, \code{qdist}, \code{pdist} and any arguments needed to
pass to them should be named.
