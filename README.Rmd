# xpose.xtras

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of xpose.xtras is to add some at-present missing functionality (to-be-deprecated as they are added to xpose), or functions unlikely to be added to the base xpose package.

# Todo
- [ ] Extend xpose_data class or add a new class with additional structures.
  - [ ] Add support for defining catcov levels
- [ ] Add support to grab xpose_plot objects
- [ ] Built-in support for contcov and catcov plots
- [ ] Built-in implementation of GGally::ggpairs
- [ ] Visualize colinearity
- [ ] table of covariates (demographics)
  - [ ] Basic tibble
  - [ ] Nice output version (similar to nice output for prm_table)
- [ ] Nice param table, incorporate pmxcv
  - [ ] Need way to reference etas to fixed effects and state transformation
